    "Students do more than sit in classrooms listening to instructors lecture on important topics. They are proactive in their learning, socialize with diverse groups of peers, and engage in enriching activities. With the many responsibilities that come with being a student, the primary goal for most is to perform well academically, while being able to manage other aspects of their life successfully. As students, we are interested in how various personal and academic lifestyle factors can have an effect on academic standing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing literature on this topic explores similar research into how personal lifestyle factors are correlated with stress level and academic standing for students. One research study exploring lifestyle factors and academic achievement found that mainly spiritual growth and living situation showed a significant positive relationship with academic achievement. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another research study by Blasche et al. was conducted on medical students at the Medical Center of Vienna, Austria where they access the effects of academic work on students’ wellbeing, specifically fatigue, vigor, and distress. They concluded that the longer students work on a mentally demanding task, the more greater degree of fatigue and distress they face, showing positive correlations between number of hours of working on the task and fatigue/distress. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Al-Roomy dives deeper specifically how stress affects academic performances, concluding that students with higher stress levels tend to achieve lower academic scores and that medical students experience higher levels of stress than nonmedical students. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "While existing literature covers the relationship between student’s well being and academic achievement, our work aims at addressing the gap in literature by identifying the factor that most significantly contributes to stress level and GPA. These factors encompass various aspects of students’ lifestyle and responsibilities that shape their academic performances. As such, our topic specifically explores how number of hours sleeping, studying, participating in extracurricular activities, socializing, and doing physical activity effect stress level and GPA, if at all. We can additionally adjust for each variable in our calculations for the others, thereby addressing confounding factors.\n",

    "We predict study time will be the most significant predictor of both GPA and stress levels, which tracks with the data from Al-Roomy, while sleep time will likely be positively correlated with GPA and negatively correlated with stress levels and social time will be negatively correlated with both. We expect higher exercise levels and extracurricular time to be predictive of lower stress levels, which may lead to higher GPAs according to the data from Blasche et al."

    "Ideally we would have data demonstrating time spent studying, sleeping, doing extracurriculars, socializing, and exercising along with stress levels and GPAs for individual students. We would need a somewhat large dataset because we are observing a large number of variables, particularly if there is missing data, to get a complete picture. Data could come from national-level, district-level, etc. surveys, as at least some of it (stress levels) would need to be self-reported. It could be stored in a csv or any other file, as the data are pretty simple.\n",
    "We found a dataset with exactly these variables on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/student-lifestyle-dataset), where it's publicly available to download. It comes from a Google form survey on primarily Indian students. All the variables can be directly used for our question.\n"

    "## Ethics \n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We don't know how much/little information was given to subjects. There was at least some degree of consent as all subjects did submit a form, but we can't know whether they knew what the information would be used for.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a specific subset of students (those who have gone through the Indian school system) due to the source of the data, which may not be perfectly representative of students in other countries. However, there's not much to be done about that without gathering our own data, so we just need to be mindful of this fact with the conclusions that we draw.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This has been done, all subjects are given anonymized ID numbers and names/actual identification information is not included.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We do not control the data, all data has been and will continue to be publicly available.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> When writing our analysis, we'll be able to address blindspots by engaging with existing literature about the subject and therefore covering our blindspots through analysis and conclusions determined by subject matter experts. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> See **A.2**.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    " > It will be... tbd\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> None of these are directly discriminatory, and while you could make an argument that several of them are somewhat related to sensitive variables, it's all in somewhat indirect ways and none could be considered actual proxies.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We tried to keep our metrics as \"raw\" as possible. That is to say, we are avoiding using proxies to minimize the effects of confounding variables and prevent optimization for those metrics from becoming less representative of what we are attempting to measure. GPA is a widely accepted standard for measuring academic performance and should be representative of it. Self-reported stress levels are the most unbiased way to measure stress we could think of.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
