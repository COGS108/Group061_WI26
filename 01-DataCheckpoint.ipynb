    "Students do more than sit in classrooms listening to instructors lecture on important topics.

With the many responsibilities that come with being a student, the primary goal for most is to perform well academically, while being able to manage other aspects of their life successfully. As students, we are interested in how various personal and academic lifestyle factors can have an effect on academic standing.\n",

    "### Ideal dataset description\n",
    "Ideally we would have data demonstrating academic habits such as time spent studying, health habits such as time spent sleeping, exercise, caffeine intake, and type of diet, and other habits such as time spent in extracurriculars, socializing, and along with stress levels and GPAs for individual students. Most of the variables would ideally be measured with time in minutes (to be as accurate as possible) except for GPA and stress which could be measured through a variety of factors such as average heart rate, cortisol levels, sweat activity, and temperature. A formal medical assessment for stress level would be more ideal given that it would likely lead to more accurate results, meaning that the collection of data for this ideal dataset would have to be authorized by a medical professional or data would have to be obtained from an authorized clinical trial. However, although not as ideal, to obtain a larger amount of datapoints, factors like stress levels would likely be self-reported. We would need a somewhat large dataset because we are observing a large number of variables, particularly if there is missing data, to get a complete picture. Data could come from national-level, district-level, etc. surveys, as at least some of it (stress levels) would likely be self-reported. It could be stored in a csv or any other file, as the data are pretty simple. We found a dataset with many of these variables on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/student-lifestyle-dataset), where it's publicly available to download. This comes from a Google form survey, with self-reported data from 2000 primarily Indian students. This dataset includes the variables of hours spent studying, sleeping, doing extracurriculars, exercising, socializing, as well as GPA and stress levels (self-reported on a scale of low-moderate-high). Different from our ideal dataset, this real dataset lacks some variables we had thought about (including factors like diet, caffeine) and also measures stress through a self-reported metric as opposed to a more medical metric as discussed previously. All the variables can be directly used for our question."

    "**Description of the variables most relevant to this project:**  All the variables included in this dataset are relevant to the projects, including study time, extracurricular time, sleep time, social time, physical activity, GPA, and stress levels. Time spent studying, doing extracurriculars, sleeping, socializing, and exercising are all measured in hours per day. In this dataset, data on studying time ranges from five to ten hours, extracurricular time ranges from zero to four hours, sleep time ranges from five to ten hours, socializing time ranges from zero to six hours, and physical activity time ranges from zero to thirteen hours per day. GPA is measured on a standard GPA scale from 0.0 to 4.0 with the range in this dataset being 2.24 to 4. Stress level is measured on a qualitative scale of low, moderate, or high. These variables are all relevant to the project given that our project is to determine the effect of different, common factors in students’ lives on their GPA and stress levels. These variables are relatively common for all students and therefore are fit to serve as a point of understanding correlations between said factors and GPA and stress levels for students. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Descriptions of any shortcomings this dataset has with respect to the project:** This dataset has some shortcomings which should be noted. First, the data is self-reported and collected through a Google form survey which may lead to inaccuracies between the data reported and the reality. While discrepancies between reported values for some variables (namely, the time reported to be spent studying, sleeping, doing extracurricular activities, exercising, and socializing) and the reality may not be big, self-reported data may be a bigger shortcoming for a variable such as stress level which is measured more subjectively in this dataset. Furthermore, this dataset comprises students primarily in India which is one country and may be not a representative sample of students in different countries. A final shortcoming of this dataset is that it is unclear whether these students are undergraduates or not and our research question aims to address undergraduate students. \n"

    "### Student Lifestyle Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is a survey styled dataset with 2,000 observations (rows) and 7 variables (columns). Each row represents one student’s response, and the dataset records how students spend time across several common activities along with two outcomes -> GPA and stress level. Because it is survey based, the values are personal estimates rather than exact measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important metrics used in this dataset are time/use variables measured in hours/day. These include Study_Hours_Per_Day, which represents time spent doing academic work such as reading, assignments, studying; Sleep_Hours_Per_Day, representing rest and recovery; Social_Hours_Per_Day, reflecting time spent socializing; Extracurricular_Hours_Per_Day, which reflects time spent in organizations, hobbies, or other structured activities outside class; and Physical_Activity_Hours_Per_Day, which represents time spent exercising or doing fitness activities. These metrics are directly aligned with our research question since they capture how students allocate time between academics, rest, social, and other commitments.\n",
    "The primary outcomes we are interested in predicting are GPA and Stress Level. GPA is a numeric measure of academic performance. Stress Level is a categorical variable that measures well being.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the dataset is composed of responses from a Google Form survey, there is a potential self-selection bias in which respondents are limited to individuals who are willing to participate and share information about their lifestyle and habits. Individuals who are more comfortable with self-disclosure about their lifestyle tend to be health-conscious, organized, and self-reflective, leading to overrepresentation of individuals with more “ideal” lifestyles or at least self-reported behaviors that appear more desirable. Furthermore, stress levels are not standardized, and because this variable is self-reported, respondents may interpret and report them differently based on their current beliefs, experience, or perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another concern of this dataset is that the respondents are primarily from India, meaning that it reflects India’s local norms and cultural context and is not representative of students on a global scale. India is one of the many countries where the family places high expectations on students to perform well academically. As a result, respondents are more likely to report higher stress levels, and their interpretation of what constitutes “high stress levels” may differ, potentially affecting how stress is interpreted in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Form surveys must be completed online through a device (computer, cell phone, etc.) and with decent internet connectivity. Those who reside in urban and more developed areas have higher accessibility to reliable connections and devices, while those who reside in rural and more remote areas lack this infrastructure, though this gap is shrinking, making this bias likely minimal but not negligible."

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We don't know how much/little information was given to subjects. There was at least some degree of consent as all subjects did submit a form, but we can't know whether they knew what the information would be used for.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a specific subset of students (those who have gone through the Indian school system) due to the source of the data, which may not be perfectly representative of students in other countries. However, there's not much to be done about that without gathering our own data, so we just need to be mindful of this fact with the conclusions that we draw.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This has been done, all subjects are given anonymized ID numbers and names/actual identification information is not included.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We do not control the data, all data has been and will continue to be publicly available.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> When writing our analysis, we'll be able to address blindspots by engaging with existing literature about the subject and therefore covering our blindspots through analysis and conclusions determined by subject matter experts. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> See **A.2**.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    " > It hasn't been done yet, but it will be\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> None of these are directly discriminatory, and while you could make an argument that several of them are somewhat related to sensitive variables, it's all in somewhat indirect ways and none could be considered actual proxies.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We tried to keep our metrics as \"raw\" as possible. That is to say, we are avoiding using proxies to minimize the effects of confounding variables and prevent optimization for those metrics from becoming less representative of what we are attempting to measure. GPA is a widely accepted standard for measuring academic performance and should be representative of it. Self-reported stress levels are the most unbiased way to measure stress we could think of.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is not a predictive model; rather we are examining whether a true predictive model *could* use these variables. It is not intended to be used as replacement for evaluating actual GPA or stress, for instance. The dataset it will be used on is constant, therefore none of these deployment considerations are particularly relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?"
